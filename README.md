# Super-Resolution Using Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing and evaluating a deep learning-based approach to **image super-resolution** â€” the task of enhancing the resolution of low-resolution images.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This was an academic assignment completed as part of a university course on deep learning and computer vision. The goal was to apply state-of-the-art techniques to upscale images and compare model performance using quantitative and qualitative metrics.

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Bicubic interpolation (baseline)
- Model training on paired low-res / high-res image data
- Evaluation using:
  - PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
  - SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

## ðŸ§ª Results

The notebook includes visual comparisons between:
- Original high-resolution images  
- Low-resolution inputs  
- Super-resolved outputs generated by the model  

The results demonstrate improved perceptual quality compared to bicubic interpolation.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

The notebook uses the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (cv2)
- scikit-image

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
